## 🎯 Overview

The **Agentic Governance Fabric (AGF)** is an AI governance multi-agent model that automates compliance auditing for AI systems against the EU AI Act. It uses a hierarchical multi-agent architecture where:

- A **Root Orchestrator Agent** manages the overall audit workflow
- **Nine specialized Sub-Agents** conduct targeted compliance assessments
- Each sub-agent focuses on a specific governance domain (risk, data, transparency, security, etc.)
- Results are aggregated into comprehensive compliance reports

This system ensures AI systems deployed in EU jurisdictions meet rigorous regulatory requirements while maintaining transparency, accountability, and risk management standards.

## ✨ Key Features

### Multi-Domain Compliance Assessment
- **Risk Assessment**: Identifies and categorizes AI system risks
- **Data Governance**: Ensures data quality, lineage, and compliance
- **Transparency & Information**: Validates user-facing disclosure requirements
- **Human Oversight**: Verifies human-in-the-loop mechanisms
- **Accuracy & Robustness**: Tests model performance and resilience
- **Technical Documentation**: Reviews system design and architecture documentation
- **Risk Management & Monitoring**: Validates risk mitigation strategies
- **Conformity Assessment**: Confirms overall EU AI Act compliance
- **Post-Market Monitoring**: Tracks ongoing compliance post-deployment

### Intelligent Orchestration
- Sequential agent execution for traceability and accountability
- Conditional sub-agent invocation based on risk assessment findings
- Strict input validation and schema enforcement
- Automated audit trail with timestamps and evidence references

### Structured Output
- Standardized compliance reporting (Compliant/Partially Compliant/Non-Compliant)
- Detailed findings with explicit evidence references
- Prioritized remediation recommendations
- Deferred evidence tracking for incomplete assessments

```

### Workflow Execution Model

1. **Initialization**: Root agent receives audit request
2. **Risk Assessment**: Mandatory first stage—identifies risk level and compliance areas
3. **Conditional Routing**: Based on risk output, determine which sub-agents to activate
4. **Sequential Execution**: Each sub-agent executes and validates findings
5. **Aggregation**: Compile results into final compliance report
6. **Output**: Standardized compliance assessment with remediation roadmap

## 📊 Compliance Assessment Workflow

### Audit Execution Flow

```
1. START: User submits AI system for audit
   ↓
2. RISK ASSESSMENT (Mandatory)
   - Analyze system architecture
   - Identify risk level
   - Determine relevant compliance domains
   ↓
3. CONDITIONAL ROUTING
   - Route to applicable sub-agents based on risk profile
   - Skip non-applicable domains
   ↓
4. SEQUENTIAL SUB-AGENT EXECUTION
   For each applicable domain:
   a. Request required inputs from user
   b. Validate input schema and completeness
   c. Execute specialized sub-agent
   d. Collect findings and evidence
   e. Record results with timestamp
   ↓
5. OUTPUT STANDARDIZATION
   Each sub-agent returns:
   - Compliance Status: Compliant/Partially Compliant/Non-Compliant
   - Findings: Detailed compliance issues
   - Evidence: References (transcript quotes, metrics, documentation)
   - Recommendations: Prioritized remediation steps
   ↓
6. AGGREGATION & SYNTHESIS
   - Compile all sub-agent findings
   - Generate executive summary
   - Create remediation roadmap
   ↓
7. REPORT GENERATION
   - Output: Comprehensive compliance assessment
   - Recommendations: Prioritized action items
   - Timeline: Suggested remediation schedule
   ↓
8. END: Audit complete with compliance determination
```

### Input Validation Gates

Each sub-agent enforces strict input requirements:

| Sub-Agent | Required Input | Optional Input | Forbidden Input |
|-----------|---|---|---|
| Risk Assessment | System description | Example conversations | N/A |
| Data Governance | Dataset metadata | Data lineage | N/A |
| Transparency | User conversations | User-facing artifacts | Internal docs, architecture |
| Human Oversight | Governance procedures | Review logs | N/A |
| Accuracy & Robustness | Performance metrics | Test reports | N/A |
| Technical Documentation | Architecture docs | Algorithm descriptions | N/A |
| Risk Management | Risk procedures | Monitoring logs | N/A |
| Conformity Assessment | Sub-agent outputs | N/A | N/A |
| Post-Market Monitoring | Production data | User feedback | N/A |

## Sample Conversations

Below is the a part of the sample conversation with the agent regarding a system called DiagBot which is an AI that provides automated preliminary medical diagnoses based on patient symptoms and medical history.

The conversation will carry on with the rest of the agents and can be found as one of the test cases: `Agentic-Governance-Fabric-AGF-/Requested Submissions/Testing/Test case 1`

## Deployment
The AI Governace Agent can be deployed to Vertex AI Agent Engine using the following commands:

```
poetry install --with deployment
python3 deployment/deploy.py --create
```
When the deployment finishes, it will print a line like this:

```
Created remote agent: projects/<PROJECT_NUMBER>/locations/<PROJECT_LOCATION>/reasoningEngines/<AGENT_ENGINE_ID>
```

To delete the deployed agent, you may run the following command:
```
python3 deployment/deploy.py --delete --resource_id=${AGENT_ENGINE_ID}
```
